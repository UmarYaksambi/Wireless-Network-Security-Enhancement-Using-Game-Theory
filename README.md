# Wireless Network Security Enhancement Using Game Theory

Welcome to the **Advanced Wireless Network Security Simulation**, a project that models the strategic interaction between attackers (jammers) and defenders in wireless networks using **Game Theory**.  
This simulation helps study how different strategies impact the resilience and performance of a wireless network under attack.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/UmarYaksambi/Wireless-Network-Security-Enhancement-Using-Game-Theory.git
cd Wireless-Network-Security-Enhancement-Using-Game-Theory
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**`requirements.txt` includes:**
- `streamlit`
- `networkx`
- `matplotlib`
- `numpy`
- `pandas`

*(Make sure you have Python 3.8+)*

### 3. Run the Simulation

```bash
streamlit run NetSim.py
```

A local Streamlit app will open in your browser, allowing you to interact with the simulation parameters.

## üìÇ Project Structure

| File | Description |
|:-----|:------------|
| `NetSim.py` | **Main Simulation**: complete Streamlit app with interactive wireless network security simulation. |
| `network.py` | Preliminary earlier attempt ‚Äî **basic network generation** (now replaced by better architecture in `NetSim.py`). |
| `requirements.txt` | Python libraries required to run the simulation. |

## üéØ How It Works

- **Users configure** the network (nodes, connectivity, number of frequencies) and **select a Game Theory model**.
- **Attackers** dynamically select strategies to jam nodes.
- **Defenders** employ strategies to adapt, protect, and restore network connectivity.
- **Payoffs** are calculated for both sides, considering cost, effectiveness, and detection.
- **Machine Learning / Reinforcement Learning** (Q-Learning and Bayesian Updates) allow strategies to evolve over time.
- **Beautiful Visualizations** show the network health and strategy outcomes at each simulation step.
